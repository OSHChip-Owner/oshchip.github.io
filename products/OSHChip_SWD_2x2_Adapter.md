##Description

The programmer/debugger for [OSHChip&nbsp;V1.0](/products/OSHChip_V1.0_Product.html),
[OSHChip_CMSIS_DAP V1.0](/products/OSHChip_CMSIS_DAP_V1.0_Product.html)
has a standard SWD interface header with 10 pins (2&nbsp;by&nbsp;5) and
spacing in X and Y of 0.050" (1.27mm). A matching ribbon cable with keyed
female IDC connectors is supplied with each OSHChip_CMSIS_DAP V1.0.

OSHChip&nbsp;V1.0 has a small 4 pin connector on the top side that is
used for programming the Flash memory, and can also be used for
debugging. The 4 pins are the minimal pins needed to implement the ARM
Cortex SWD interface.

The **OSHChip SWD 2x2 Adapter** provides a compact conversion from
the 10 pin standard to the 4 pin connector on OSHChip.
