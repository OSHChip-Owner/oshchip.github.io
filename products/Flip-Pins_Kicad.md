The Kicad library for Flip-Pins contains 3 schematic symbols for the 3
sizes (8, 14, and 20 pins) with 3D models that are only the pins. With
these, you can visualize what your board will look like when you are
finished.

The library also contains 3 schematic symbols that have 3D models that
include the plastic aligner. With these, you can check for clearances
around the aligner.
