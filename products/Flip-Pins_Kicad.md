The Kicad library for Flip-Pins contains 3 schematic symbols, and for
each symbol, you can choose between two footprints.

* One footprint has the 3D model of just the pins, so you can visualize
  what your board will look like when you are finished

* One footprint has the 3D model that includes the plastic aligner, so
  you can check for clearances around the aligner.
