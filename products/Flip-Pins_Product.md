## Description

Flip-Pins are the third generation of the Integrated Circuit (IC)
pins designed by Fliptronics for use in products like OSHChip. The
goal for Flip-Pins was to create pins that could be soldered into
a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and to look as much like an IC pin
as possible. _(Current production OSHChips use the second generation
pins, and will change over to third generation with the next
production run.)_ With the plastic aligner, the pins are held 0.1"
apart, with a .062" solder tail exposed.

A significant feature of Flip-Pins is that their width (.020") is the
same as traditional Dual-Inline-Package (DIP) IC pins, and so Flip-Pins
are directly compatible with standard Breadboards. Many people use
header pins which are .025" square to connect their PCBs to breadboards,
and are unaware that header pins damage the breadboard because they are
wider than standard DIP pins.

Flip-Pin are available in 3 lengths: 8, 14, and 20 pins. Other
lengths can be achieved by either using multiple strips, or removing
pins from a strip.

## How they are used (quick version)

When soldered into PCBs that are commonly .062" thick, a near flush
surface can be achieved on the non-pin side of the PCB (see pictures
below). After soldering the pins into your PCB, the plastic aligner
can be easily removed and discarded.

## Compatibility

Examples of breadboards that Flip-Pins were designed for:

* [EMSL 170 point Breadboard](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/partsmenu/439){:target="_blank"}
* [EMSL 630 Point Transparent Breadboard](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/partsmenu/623){:target="_blank"}
* [DigiKey 170 point Breadboard](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/parallax-inc/700-00012/700-00012-ND){:target="_blank"}
* [DigiKey 830 point Breadboard](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/twin-industries/TW-E40-1020/438-1045-ND){:target="_blank"}
* [Sparkfun 170 point Breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12043){:target="_blank"}
* [Sparkfun 830 point Breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12615){:target="_blank"}
* [Adafruit 170 point Breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/products/65){:target="_blank"}
* [Adafruit 830 point Breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/products/239){:target="_blank"}

Flip-Pins are compatible with IC sockets that have flat contacts, for example:

* [EMSL 16 pin DIP sockets](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/partsmenu/494){:target="_blank"}
* [Digikey 16 pin DIP sockets](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/on-shore-technology-inc/ED16DT/ED3046-5-ND){:target="_blank"}
* [Sparkfun 16 pin DIP sockets](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/7938){:target="_blank"}
* [Adafruit 16 pin DIP sockets](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2203){:target="_blank"}

Flip-Pins might not be compatible with IC sockets that have a round entry hole
for the IC pin. Please check carefully with an actual socket. For example, these types
of sockets: [DigiKey ED3016-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/on-shore-technology-inc/SA163000/ED3016-ND){:target="_blank"}


Examples of Boards that can be used with Flip-Pins
