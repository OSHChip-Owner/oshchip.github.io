OSHChip V1.0 is a minature processor board that packs an amazing amount of functionality into the space of a traditional 16 pin DIP package. It is only 0.3” (8.9 mm) wide and 0.78” (19.8 mm) long. Designed specifically for the hobbyist in mind, it features custom IC pins that are exactly what solderless breadboards are designed for. With its 0.3” (7.6 mm) pin pitch, it can plug into the middle two rows of holes on a breadboard (just like any .3” DIP package device), and the remainder of the connection holes are available for your jumper wires. (unlike other products that cover many of the holes you might want to use.)


OSHChip was designed by Philip Freidin. The development project logs
can be found here [OSHChip V1.0 on Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/7212-oshchip-v10)

OSHChip was a Quarterfinalist in the 2015 Hackaday Prize competition.
