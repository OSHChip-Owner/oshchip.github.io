OSHChip&nbsp;V1.0 has a small 4 pin connector on the top side that is
used for programming the Flash memory, and can also be used for
debugging. The 4 pins are the minimal pins needed to implement the ARM
Cortex SWD interface. SWD is used on ARM processors from many
companies, and so OSHChip_CMSIS_DAP&nbsp;V1.0 can be used with
products other than OSHChip. The SWD standard specifies a 10 pin
(2&nbsp;by&nbsp;5) connector with pin spacing in X and Y of 0.050"
(1.27mm). To convert from the 2&nbsp;by&nbsp;5 layout on the
OSHChip_CMSIS_DAP&nbsp;V1.0 to the 2&nbsp;by&nbsp;2 layout on the
OSHChip, a small adapter [OSHChip SWD 2x2
Adapter](/products/OSHChip_SWD_2x2_Adapter.html) is available.
