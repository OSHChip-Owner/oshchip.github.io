* Q: Can I buy OSChip pins?
  * A: Not yet, but sometime later in 2016 they will be offered  
      as a separate product.

* Q: Which processor is used in OSHChip?
  * A: The Nordic Semiconductors nRF51822-CFAC-A0. Have  
    a look at the banner picture at the top of the page.

* Q: I need a really tiny processor board for a wearable I am  
  designing, can I buy OSHChip without the pins?
  * A: Not yet, maybe in the future. It will be at the same  
    price as OSHChip with pins. Until then, you can buy the  
    OSHChip with pins, and they are easy to unsolder from  
    the board.
