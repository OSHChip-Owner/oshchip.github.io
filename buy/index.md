OSHChip is planning to have an online store front on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/)
but it has not yet been setup. Until then, sales enquiries can be sent to
[philip@oshchip.org](mailto:philip@oshchip.org)

###Typical Orders

Typically you will buy one or more OSHChips and one programmer if you don't
already have one. The standard programming cable is a 10 wire ribon cable
with a 0.050" pitch 2&nbsp;by&nbsp;5 pin female polarized IDC connector at
each end.

There is no current discount for larger quantities.

If you already have an SWD programmer from another vendor, provided
you also have a programming cable with the 0.050" pitch
2&nbsp;by&nbsp;5 IDC connector on the end, you can get by without the
adapter. The required signals are in the 2&nbsp;by&nbsp;2 signals on
the cable at the red stripe (pin 1) end of the connector. The cable
orientation is the same as that used when the adapter is available.
When attaching the cable to OSHChip, just be very careful that the 4
pins from OSHChip go into the 4 holes in the connector that are
closest to the red stripe on the cable.

Example SWD programmers include:

* OSHChip_CMSIS_DAP V1.0
* Segger J-Link
* Segger J-Link Lite
* Keil ULink
* Nordic Semiconductor nRF51-DK

The following have not been tested, but may work using the Keil IDE

* CooCox CoLinkEx
* PEmicro Multilink

If you do not already have a programmer, then you should also order
an OSHChip_CMSIS_DAP V1.0 .   It comes with a programming cable and
an adapter board that converts from the 2



no USB cable
